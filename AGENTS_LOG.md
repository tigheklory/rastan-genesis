## [Architect Review - Build 88 Technical Audit]

### 1. Aliasing Audit
**Confirmed.**
The spec `specs/startup_title_remap.json` currently maps `0xC00000`, `0xC04000`, `0xC08000`, and `0xC0C000` to the single symbol `genesistan_shadow_c_window_words`.
This results in a 4-to-1 aliasing where writes to distinct arcade video pages overwrite the same Genesis shadow buffer index. This explains the garbled title screen text (text overwriting background or vice versa).

### 2. Fault Analysis (0xD000DA)
**Confirmed Unmapped Literal.**
The address `0xD000DA` is missing from the `absolute_rewrite_groups` in the current spec.
Since `allow_in_code` is disabled for safety (Decision 2026-03-17), this absolute address literal in the code is not being rewritten.
Accessing `0xD000DA` on Genesis (unmapped space) causes the observed crash/freeze.

### 3. Mitigation Strategy
1.  **Split C-Window Shadows**: Define four separate 16KB shadow buffers in `apps/rastan/src/main.c`.
2.  **Remap Pages**: Update `specs/startup_title_remap.json` to map each 0xC0xxxx page to its own unique shadow symbol.
3.  **Patch D000DA**: Add `0xD000DA` to the explicit D-window absolute remap group targeting `genesistan_shadow_d00000_words` (offset 218).

## [Implementer Update - Build 88]

### Fixes Implemented
- Confirmed: `specs/startup_title_remap.json` now decouples prior 4-to-1 C-window aliasing with distinct mappings:
  - `0x00C00000 -> genesistan_shadow_c00000_words`
  - `0x00C04000 -> genesistan_shadow_c04000_words`
  - `0x00C08000 -> genesistan_shadow_c08000_words`
  - `0x00C0C000 -> genesistan_shadow_c0c000_words`
- Confirmed: `0x00D000DA` is mapped in D-window group to `genesistan_shadow_d00000_words` with `offset: 218`.

### Build Blocker
- Current state is `LINKER FAILURE` due to WRAM exhaustion.
- Cause: addition of 4 x 16KB volatile C-window shadow buffers (64KB total) pushes `.bss` past Genesis WRAM capacity (`$E00000-$FFFFFF`).
- Reported linker error: `.bss exceeds ram region at 0xE100BECC`.

### Integrity Check
- Confirmed unshifted arcade code offsets in spec:
  - `0x03AE86`
  - `0x039F80`
  - `0x03B098`

### Final Status
- Build 88: `Logic Complete / Memory Blocked`.

# External Technical Consultant — Build 89 Memory Pivot Review
Date: 2026-03-18  
Reviewer: External Technical Consultant

---

## Summary

Recommend proceeding with the **SRAM experiment for Build 89**, but **only behind a switchable memory-backend abstraction layer**.

This allows the project to:

- Test quickly using standard Genesis cartridge SRAM.
- Pivot later to **true 16-bit cartridge RAM** without rewriting the engine or title-screen code.

---

## Architectural Assessment

### Genesis Cartridge SRAM Location

Standard Genesis/Mega Drive backup SRAM is conventionally mapped in cartridge space around: $200000

SRAM access is controlled via:

$A130F1

---

### SRAM Bus Behavior

The compatibility baseline for Genesis SRAM is typically:

- **Byte-wide**
- **Odd-byte addressing**

This means it should **not be assumed to behave like generic 16-bit work RAM**.

---

### Flash Cart Behavior

Some flash carts internally use wider RAM (for example DRAM behind an FPGA), but compatibility expectations still follow the **standard SRAM behavior model**.

Therefore:

> SRAM should be treated as a **compatibility/testing backend**, not the final architectural assumption.

---

## Recommendation for Build 89

### 1. Introduce a Shadow Memory Abstraction Layer

Define four logical shadow pages corresponding to the arcade C-window.

| Logical Page | Arcade Address |
|---------------|----------------|
| PAGE0 | `$C00000` |
| PAGE1 | `$C04000` |
| PAGE2 | `$C08000` |
| PAGE3 | `$C0C000` |

Each page represents **16 KB of logical storage**.

---

### 2. Route All Access Through an API

Example interface:

shadow_read8(page, offset)
shadow_write8(page, offset, value)

shadow_read16(page, offset)
shadow_write16(page, offset, value)
shadow_read8(page, offset)
shadow_write8(page, offset, value)

shadow_read16(page, offset)
shadow_write16(page, offset, value)

No higher-level code should access cartridge memory directly.

---

### 3. Backend A — SRAM Compatible (Build 89)

Implementation characteristics:

- Uses SRAM region near `$200000`
- Packed or translated storage layout
- Designed to remain **odd-byte compatible**
- Does **not expose raw 16-bit linear memory semantics**

Purpose:

- Emulator testing
- Mega EverDrive testing
- Early hardware validation

---

### 4. Backend B — True Cartridge RAM (Future Hardware)

Future backend for custom hardware:

- 16-bit SRAM or RAM device
- Direct word reads/writes
- Same logical page API

Important:

> No engine code should change when switching backends.

Only the backend implementation changes.

---

### 5. Prevent Hardcoded SRAM Dependencies

Game logic must **never directly reference `$200000`**.

All cartridge shadow storage must be accessed through the abstraction layer.

This ensures:

- Easy hardware pivots
- Emulator portability
- Cleaner debugging

---

## Risk Notes

### SRAM Compatibility

SRAM at `$200000` is widely supported for testing, but the safest assumption remains:

- **odd-byte compatible**
- **save-RAM style behavior**

Not generic WRAM.

---

### Flash Cart Variability

Some flash carts internally use wider RAM, but that behavior is **implementation specific** and should not be relied upon.

---

### Dev Cart Differences

Some development cartridges (e.g., Open-ED) do **not implement persistent SRAM**, so behavior may differ from EverDrive devices.

---

## Architectural Conclusion

Proceed with the SRAM experiment **as a backend implementation only**, not as a permanent architectural dependency.

This preserves forward compatibility with:

- standard SRAM testing
- EverDrive flash carts
- emulator environments
- future **custom 16-bit RAM cartridges**

---

## [Architect Review - Build 89 SRAM Pivot]

### Design Strategy
To resolve the Build 88 WRAM overflow, we are moving the 64KB of C-Window shadow buffers to the Genesis cartridge SRAM window (`0x200000`).

### Memory Map
- **Origin:** `0x200000`
- **Length:** `64KB`
- **Layout:** 4 logical pages of 16KB each, mapped linearly.

### Compatibility Abstraction
We implemented a `shadow_` API in `main.c` to abstract the backend.
- **Access Method:** Explicit 8-bit byte-splitting.
- **Constraint:** While the API uses safe 8-bit access patterns, fitting 64KB of data into 64KB of address space requires a "16-bit SRAM" or linear-mapped configuration. Standard 8-bit-only save RAM (odd addresses only) would require 128KB of address space for this amount of data.
- **Target:** This configuration is valid for Emulator (SRAM 16-bit mode) and EverDrive development, which is sufficient to unblock the current logic testing.

### Status
- **Linker:** Defined `sram` region.
- **Runtime:** Implemented `shadow_init`, `shadow_write16`, `shadow_read16`.
- **Next Step:** Compile and verify C-Window text rendering.
