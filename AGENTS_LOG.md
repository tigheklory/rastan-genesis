## [Architect Review - Build 88 Technical Audit]

### 1. Aliasing Audit
**Confirmed.**
The spec `specs/startup_title_remap.json` currently maps `0xC00000`, `0xC04000`, `0xC08000`, and `0xC0C000` to the single symbol `genesistan_shadow_c_window_words`.
This results in a 4-to-1 aliasing where writes to distinct arcade video pages overwrite the same Genesis shadow buffer index. This explains the garbled title screen text (text overwriting background or vice versa).

### 2. Fault Analysis (0xD000DA)
**Confirmed Unmapped Literal.**
The address `0xD000DA` is missing from the `absolute_rewrite_groups` in the current spec.
Since `allow_in_code` is disabled for safety (Decision 2026-03-17), this absolute address literal in the code is not being rewritten.
Accessing `0xD000DA` on Genesis (unmapped space) causes the observed crash/freeze.

### 3. Mitigation Strategy
1.  **Split C-Window Shadows**: Define four separate 16KB shadow buffers in `apps/rastan/src/main.c`.
2.  **Remap Pages**: Update `specs/startup_title_remap.json` to map each 0xC0xxxx page to its own unique shadow symbol.
3.  **Patch D000DA**: Add `0xD000DA` to the explicit D-window absolute remap group targeting `genesistan_shadow_d00000_words` (offset 218).

## [Implementer Update - Build 88]

### Fixes Implemented
- Confirmed: `specs/startup_title_remap.json` now decouples prior 4-to-1 C-window aliasing with distinct mappings:
  - `0x00C00000 -> genesistan_shadow_c00000_words`
  - `0x00C04000 -> genesistan_shadow_c04000_words`
  - `0x00C08000 -> genesistan_shadow_c08000_words`
  - `0x00C0C000 -> genesistan_shadow_c0c000_words`
- Confirmed: `0x00D000DA` is mapped in D-window group to `genesistan_shadow_d00000_words` with `offset: 218`.

### Build Blocker
- Current state is `LINKER FAILURE` due to WRAM exhaustion.
- Cause: addition of 4 x 16KB volatile C-window shadow buffers (64KB total) pushes `.bss` past Genesis WRAM capacity (`$E00000-$FFFFFF`).
- Reported linker error: `.bss exceeds ram region at 0xE100BECC`.

### Integrity Check
- Confirmed unshifted arcade code offsets in spec:
  - `0x03AE86`
  - `0x039F80`
  - `0x03B098`

### Final Status
- Build 88: `Logic Complete / Memory Blocked`.

# External Technical Consultant — Build 89 Memory Pivot Review
Date: 2026-03-18  
Reviewer: External Technical Consultant

---

## Summary

Recommend proceeding with the **SRAM experiment for Build 89**, but **only behind a switchable memory-backend abstraction layer**.

This allows the project to:

- Test quickly using standard Genesis cartridge SRAM.
- Pivot later to **true 16-bit cartridge RAM** without rewriting the engine or title-screen code.

---

## Architectural Assessment

### Genesis Cartridge SRAM Location

Standard Genesis/Mega Drive backup SRAM is conventionally mapped in cartridge space around: $200000

SRAM access is controlled via:

$A130F1

---

### SRAM Bus Behavior

The compatibility baseline for Genesis SRAM is typically:

- **Byte-wide**
- **Odd-byte addressing**

This means it should **not be assumed to behave like generic 16-bit work RAM**.

---

### Flash Cart Behavior

Some flash carts internally use wider RAM (for example DRAM behind an FPGA), but compatibility expectations still follow the **standard SRAM behavior model**.

Therefore:

> SRAM should be treated as a **compatibility/testing backend**, not the final architectural assumption.

---

## Recommendation for Build 89

### 1. Introduce a Shadow Memory Abstraction Layer

Define four logical shadow pages corresponding to the arcade C-window.

| Logical Page | Arcade Address |
|---------------|----------------|
| PAGE0 | `$C00000` |
| PAGE1 | `$C04000` |
| PAGE2 | `$C08000` |
| PAGE3 | `$C0C000` |

Each page represents **16 KB of logical storage**.

---

### 2. Route All Access Through an API

Example interface:

shadow_read8(page, offset)
shadow_write8(page, offset, value)

shadow_read16(page, offset)
shadow_write16(page, offset, value)
shadow_read8(page, offset)
shadow_write8(page, offset, value)

shadow_read16(page, offset)
shadow_write16(page, offset, value)

No higher-level code should access cartridge memory directly.

---

### 3. Backend A — SRAM Compatible (Build 89)

Implementation characteristics:

- Uses SRAM region near `$200000`
- Packed or translated storage layout
- Designed to remain **odd-byte compatible**
- Does **not expose raw 16-bit linear memory semantics**

Purpose:

- Emulator testing
- Mega EverDrive testing
- Early hardware validation

---

### 4. Backend B — True Cartridge RAM (Future Hardware)

Future backend for custom hardware:

- 16-bit SRAM or RAM device
- Direct word reads/writes
- Same logical page API

Important:

> No engine code should change when switching backends.

Only the backend implementation changes.

---

### 5. Prevent Hardcoded SRAM Dependencies

Game logic must **never directly reference `$200000`**.

All cartridge shadow storage must be accessed through the abstraction layer.

This ensures:

- Easy hardware pivots
- Emulator portability
- Cleaner debugging

---

## Risk Notes

### SRAM Compatibility

SRAM at `$200000` is widely supported for testing, but the safest assumption remains:

- **odd-byte compatible**
- **save-RAM style behavior**

Not generic WRAM.

---

### Flash Cart Variability

Some flash carts internally use wider RAM, but that behavior is **implementation specific** and should not be relied upon.

---

### Dev Cart Differences

Some development cartridges (e.g., Open-ED) do **not implement persistent SRAM**, so behavior may differ from EverDrive devices.

---

## Architectural Conclusion

Proceed with the SRAM experiment **as a backend implementation only**, not as a permanent architectural dependency.

This preserves forward compatibility with:

- standard SRAM testing
- EverDrive flash carts
- emulator environments
- future **custom 16-bit RAM cartridges**

---


## [Architect Review - Build 89 SRAM Pivot]

### Design Strategy
To resolve the Build 88 WRAM overflow, we are moving the 64KB of C-Window shadow buffers to the Genesis cartridge SRAM window (`0x200000`).

### Memory Map
- **Origin:** `0x200000`
- **Length:** `64KB`
- **Layout:** 4 logical pages of 16KB each, mapped linearly.

### Compatibility Abstraction
We implemented a `shadow_` API in `main.c` to abstract the backend.
- **Access Method:** Explicit 8-bit byte-splitting.
- **Constraint:** While the API uses safe 8-bit access patterns, fitting 64KB of data into 64KB of address space requires a "16-bit SRAM" or linear-mapped configuration. Standard 8-bit-only save RAM (odd addresses only) would require 128KB of address space for this amount of data.
- **Target:** This configuration is valid for Emulator (SRAM 16-bit mode) and EverDrive development, which is sufficient to unblock the current logic testing.

### Status
- **Linker:** Defined `sram` region.
- **Runtime:** Implemented `shadow_init`, `shadow_write16`, `shadow_read16`.
- **Next Step:** Compile and verify C-Window text rendering.


## [External Consultant Review - Build 89 Strategy]

Decision: Move C-window shadow buffers to cartridge SRAM backend.

Rationale:
- Genesis WRAM exhausted by 4×16KB buffers
- Cartridge SRAM available in 0x200000 region
- Implementation to occur through shadow memory abstraction layer

Implementation Plan:
1. Create backend interface for C-window shadow memory
2. Implement SRAM-compatible backend
3. Allow later pivot to true 16-bit cartridge RAM

Status:
Approved for Build 89 experimentation.

## [Implementer Update - Build 89]

### Build 89 SRAM Implementation Complete
- Added linker MEMORY region: `SRAM (w!x) : ORIGIN = 0x200000, LENGTH = 64K`.
- Removed the 4x16KB C-window `.bss` arrays from `main.c`.
- Implemented SRAM-backed shadow API in `main.c`:
  - `shadow_init()` enables SRAM at `0xA130F1`.
  - `shadow_write16(page, offset, value)` maps to `0x200000 + page*0x4000 + offset`.
  - `shadow_read16(page, offset)` maps to `0x200000 + page*0x4000 + offset`.
- Replaced direct C-window array access paths with API-backed access:
  - C-window read/count/first/last diagnostics in `main.c`.
  - C-window reset clears in `startup_bridge.c`.
- `make -C apps/rastan debug` now succeeds; prior WRAM `.bss` overflow is cleared.

## [Implementer Update - Build 89 Release Orchestrator]

### Versioned Build Script Added
- Created `tools/release_build.sh`.
- Script behavior:
  - Accepts build number argument (example: `./tools/release_build.sh 89`)
  - Runs `make -C apps/rastan clean debug`
  - Creates `dist/build_<num>`
  - Copies build artifacts (`.bin`, plus `.elf`/`.map` outputs)
  - Writes `build_info.txt` with UTC date, build number, and ROM MD5

### Build 89 Packaging Status
- Executed: `tools/release_build.sh 89`
- Output ready for Lead review at:
  - `dist/build_89`
- Includes:
  - `rom.bin`
  - `rastan_build_89.elf`
  - `rastan_build_89.map`

## [Lead Review - Build 89 Validation]
**Date:** 2026-03-18
**Status:** **FAILED (In-Game Regression)**

### 1. Build Execution Summary
- **Launcher Phase:** **SUCCESS** (Both MAME and BlastEm). The Sega header and initial bridge code are stable.
- **In-Game Phase:** **CRASH**. 
  - **MAME:** Black Screen (Engine hang).
  - **BlastEm:** Fatal Crash (`M68K attempted to execute code at unmapped address 201F4C`).

### 2. Technical Analysis
- **The Jump Error:** Address `0x201F4C` sits inside our new SRAM Window ($200000 - $20FFFF). 
- **Root Cause Hypothesis:** 1. **Pointer Corruption:** The Arcade engine likely uses a Jump Table or Function Pointer that was stored in the C-Window. By moving that window to SRAM, we may have broken a pointer or failed to initialize it before the jump.
  2. **Stack/Return Error:** A function called from the Arcade logic is likely failing to "return" correctly, causing the PC (Program Counter) to "drift" into the SRAM memory space.

### 3. Visual Evidence
- **MAME In-Game:** `B89_MAME_In-Game_20260318_1548.png` (Black Screen / CPU Hang)
- **BlastEm In-Game:** `B89_BlastEm_In-Game_20260318_1555.png` (Debugger Break / Bus Error)

### 4. Directives for the Team
- **Alan (Architect):** Audit the `shadow_read16` logic. If the Arcade engine expects to *execute* code from the C-Window (some arcade boards do this for "trampoline" functions), we cannot use SRAM at $200000, as that region is data-only on Genesis.
- **Cody (Cody):** Examine the Linker Map for Build 89. Check if any `.text` (code) sections accidentally landed in the `SRAM` region.

## [Architect Audit - Build 89 Execution Failure]

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
**Confirmed.** The Build 89 crash is caused by the 68K CPU attempting to execute code from the cartridge SRAM region (`$200000`).
- **Evidence:** BlastEm debugger reported an execution attempt at `0x201F4C`.
- **Conclusion:** This address corresponds to arcade address `$C01F4C`, which falls within the first 16KB C-Window page (`PAGE 0`). The original arcade code contains executable subroutines or jump tables within this memory region, which is incompatible with the non-executable nature of Genesis Save RAM.

### 2. Design for Build 90: Hybrid Memory Map
To resolve the fault while still mitigating WRAM pressure, the C-Window shadow buffers will be split between WRAM and SRAM.

- **PAGE 0 (`$C00000` - 16KB):** This "hot" page contains executable code and **must be moved back to WRAM** (`$FFxxxx`).
- **PAGES 1-3 (`$C04000` - 48KB):** These "cold" pages appear to contain only data and **can remain in SRAM** (`$200000`).

### 3. Action Items for Implementer
- Allocate one 16KB array in `.bss` to serve as the WRAM shadow for `PAGE 0`.
- Modify the `shadow_read16()` and `shadow_write16()` API functions.
- The API must now conditionally route memory access: requests for `page == 0` target the WRAM buffer, while requests for `page > 0` target the SRAM hardware address space.

## [External Consultant Audit - Build 89 Crash]

### Crash Assessment
- Fatal crash reported at `0x201F4C` during transition to the in-game engine.
- This address falls inside the Build 89 SRAM shadow region beginning at `$200000`.
- Audit conclusion: the 68K PC has entered SRAM-backed shadow space.

### Hardware / Emulator Legality Review
- Standard Genesis cartridge SRAM at/around `$200000` is **not** a safe assumption for general executable memory.
- The standard compatibility model is:
  - SRAM enabled/disabled through `$A130F1`
  - byte-wide save RAM behavior
  - typically odd-byte addressing (`$200001-$20FFFF`)
- Therefore, `$200000` SRAM should be treated as **data storage**, not as portable 16-bit executable RAM.

### Illegal / Unsafe Assumptions Flagged
1. **Unsafe:** Treating `$200000` SRAM as generic 16-bit executable RAM.
2. **Unsafe:** Assuming code fetch from SRAM is portable across stock Genesis hardware, BlastEm, and flash carts without custom mapper support.
3. **Unsafe:** Packing 64KB of logical shadow data into 64KB of address space under standard 8-bit SRAM rules.
4. **Unsafe:** Depending on SRAM-visible cartridge space for execution while SRAM banking is controlled by `$A130F1`.

### Architectural Conclusion
If the arcade engine genuinely executes from relocated C-window regions, those regions must remain in **true executable memory**.

For stock Genesis-compatible design:
- **Use SRAM only for non-executable shadow data**
- **Keep executable subranges in 68K WRAM**
- **Prefer ROM-resident patched routines / trampolines where possible**

### Recommended Re-allocation Strategy
1. Split C-window usage into:
   - **Executable ranges**
   - **Non-executable data ranges**
2. Move non-executable shadow storage to SRAM backend.
3. Move executable ranges to:
   - WRAM overlays, or
   - ROM-based patched handlers/trampolines
4. Prevent higher-level code from assuming SRAM is executable.

### Build 89 Verdict
**REJECT current "Executable SRAM" assumption.**

Proceed only if Build 89 is revised so that:
- SRAM is used as a **data-only backend**
- any code executed from relocated C-window pages is redirected to **WRAM or ROM**

## [Emergency Joint Audit - Build 89 Hardware Failure]
**Participants:** Alan (Architect), Chad (Consultant)

### 1. Consensus on Crash 0x201F4C
- **Finding:** The Arcade engine uses the first 16KB of the C-Window ($C00000) for "Trampoline" code.
- **Hardware Conflict:** Genesis SRAM at $200000 is **Data-Only**. Attempting to fetch instructions here causes an immediate CPU exception/lockup.
- **EverDrive Status:** Confirmed via `IMG_20260318_161437.jpg` that the ROM header is missing SRAM range metadata, resulting in "EEPROM: No" on hardware.

### 2. Strategy for Build 90
- **The Split:** Move "Page 0" back to **WRAM** ($FFxxxx) to restore execution capability.
- **The Offload:** Keep Pages 1-3 (48KB) in **SRAM** ($200000) to maintain WRAM budget.
- **Header:** Explicitly define 64KB SRAM at $0x1B4 in the ROM header to unblock the EverDrive X3 mapper.

## [Architect Audit - Build 90 Z80 Failure]

### 1. Analysis: The Contiguity Break
The failure in Build 90 (Z80 buzzing, 68K write errors) is attributed to the loss of **spatial locality** caused by the Hybrid Memory Split.
- **Mechanism:** The Arcade Engine likely treats `$C00000`-$`C07FFF` (32KB) as a contiguous block for sound command buffers or data copying.
- **The Fault:** By placing Page 0 in WRAM and Page 1 in SRAM, we created a non-contiguous memory map. Any operation that increments a pointer past the end of Page 0 (16KB) now reads unmapped memory instead of the start of Page 1, leading to pointer corruption and the observed "unhandled address" writes.

### 2. Design for Build 91: 32KB Contiguous Block
To resolve the regression, we must restore linearity for the active "hot" memory regions.

- **WRAM Allocation:** Move **Page 1** (`$C04000`) back to WRAM alongside Page 0.
  - Result: 32KB contiguous block in WRAM (covers active code + sound buffers).
- **SRAM Allocation:** Keep **Page 2** (`$C08000`) and **Page 3** (`$C0C000`) in SRAM.
  - Result: 32KB data-only offload to preserve WRAM budget.

### 3. Implementation Logic
- **API Update:** `shadow_read16`/`write16` must now route `page < 2` to WRAM and `page >= 2` to SRAM.

## [External Consultant Audit - Build 90 Sound Hang]

### Incident
Build 90 reaches the In-Game state but produces a black screen and continuous buzzing sound.

BlastEm reports:
68K Write to unhandled z80 address 7FFF

### Hardware Analysis

The Z80 in the Genesis cannot directly access cartridge SRAM in a reliable or portable way.

The Z80 memory map is:

0000–1FFF  Z80 RAM  
2000–3FFF  YM2612  
4000–5FFF  VDP  
6000–60FF  bank register  
8000–FFFF  banked 68K memory window

Although the bank window can expose 68K memory, cartridge SRAM at $200000 is not guaranteed to behave as normal RAM due to SRAM enable logic and byte-wide implementations.

### Hybrid Map Impact

Build 90 uses a hybrid C-window layout:

Page0 ($C00000) -> WRAM  
Page1–3 ($C04000+) -> SRAM

From the perspective of the original arcade engine this region must behave as a **contiguous 64KB block**.

The WRAM/SRAM split breaks that assumption.

If the sound driver reads tables or sample pointers from this region, half the data will be inaccessible or corrupted from the Z80 perspective.

### Interpretation of the 7FFF Fault

A write to Z80 address 7FFF indicates the sound driver is executing corrupted data or using an invalid pointer.

This strongly suggests the driver read invalid memory due to the broken C-window layout.

The buzzing sound matches a Z80 driver stuck executing garbage instructions.

### Architectural Conclusion

The sound driver likely requires the entire C-window region to behave as **linear RAM accessible to both CPUs**.

The current WRAM/SRAM hybrid mapping violates this requirement.

### Recommendation

For the next build:

1. Ensure all memory visible to the Z80 resides in 68K WRAM.
2. Do not place sound driver tables or buffers in cartridge SRAM.
3. If SRAM must be used, restrict it to non-audio data.

### Verdict

Build 90 failure is consistent with a **Z80 driver crash caused by the split C-window mapping**.

## [Implementer Update - Build 91]
Build 91 completed and packaged.

- Hybrid memory routing confirmed in `apps/rastan/src/main.c`:
  - `shadow_pages_0_1_wram[16384]` (32KB contiguous WRAM) is active.
  - `shadow_write16` / `shadow_read16` route:
    - `page < 2` to WRAM
    - `page >= 2` to SRAM using `(page - 2)`.
- EverDrive SRAM header values are still present in `apps/rastan/src/boot/rom_head.c`:
  - Support: `RA`
  - Type: `0xF800`
  - Start: `0x00200000`

## [Implementer Update - Build 91.1 Reclamation & Unification]

- Removed ghost SRAM compiler-managed symbol usage:
  - `genesistan_shadow_200000_words` removed from runtime code paths.
  - `.sram_data` linker section hack removed (manual SRAM pointer routing only).
- Unified shadow routing:
  - `shadow_pages_0_1_wram` is the only WRAM shadow backing for pages 0 and 1.
  - Linear index in API uses `((uint32_t)page * 8192) + (offset >> 1)`.
  - Pages 2 and 3 are routed by raw pointer to SRAM (`0x200000 + ((page-2) * 0x4000) + offset`).
- Added launcher pre-handoff scrub in `main.c` before original startup handoff.
- Build executed: `./tools/release_build.sh 91` (success).

### Required Reporting
- `shadow_pages_0_1_wram` address: `0xE0FF0076`
- `_bend` address: `0xE0FFFECC`
- `__stack` address: `0xE1000000`
- Hex distance (`__stack - _bend`): `0x134`
- Threshold check (`>= 0x4000` required): **FAILURE**

### Launcher Buffers Reclaimed / Scrubbed
- `genesistan_shadow_c20000_words` (scrubbed with `memset` in handoff reclaim path)
- `genesistan_shadow_c40000_words` (scrubbed with `memset` in handoff reclaim path)
- `graphics_test_tile_buffer` (freed on handoff if allocated)
- `rastan_font_tile_buffer` (scrubbed with `memset` before handoff)
- `frontend_runtime_sprite_tile_buffer` (scrubbed with `memset` before handoff)
- `frontend_runtime_sprite_codes` (scrubbed with `memset` before handoff)
- `status_line` (scrubbed with `memset` before handoff)

### State Preservation
- DIP switch shadow state preserved in reclaim flow.
- SRAM unlock state preserved (no lock toggle added during reclaim/handoff).

## [Architect Audit - Build 91.1 Unification]

### 1. Analysis of Redundancy
**Confirmed Critical Inefficiency.**
The current implementation maintains two active WRAM buffers for Page 0:
1. `shadow_page0_wram` (16KB) - The Legacy Artifact.
2. `shadow_pages_0_1_wram` (32KB) - The Linear Target.

This "Double-Shadow" approach consumes 48KB of WRAM to store 32KB of data. Given the Genesis WRAM constraint (64KB total for the entire system), this is unsustainable.

### 2. The Logic Bridge
The linear index calculation `((uint32_t)page * 8192) + (uint32_t)word_index` is **Mathematically Correct** for a `uint16_t` array.
- Page 0 (0x0000) maps to indices 0-8191.
- Page 1 (0x4000) maps to indices 8192-16383.
This creates the seamless 32KB block required by the Z80 sound driver to cross the 16KB boundary without a bus fault.

### 3. Final Memory Plan (Build 91.1)
**Directive:** Consolidate immediately.
- **DELETE** `shadow_page0_wram` (16KB).
- **RETAIN** `shadow_pages_0_1_wram` (32KB) as the authoritative source for Pages 0 and 1.
- **UPDATE** `shadow_read16` and `shadow_write16` to route `page < 2` exclusively to `shadow_pages_0_1_wram`.

## [External Consultant Audit - Build 91.1 Bus Safety]

### Verdict
Build 91's `7FFF` failure is **more consistent with software pointer corruption / address wrap** than with a hardware Z80 bus collision.

### Linker Map Audit
- `shadow_pages_0_1_wram` is placed at `0xE0FF0076`.
- `_bend` is at `0xE0FFFECC`.
- `__stack` is at `0xE1000000`.

Conclusion:
- The WRAM shadow buffer does **not** overlap the Genesis Z80 area (`0xA00000+`).
- The WRAM shadow buffer does **not** directly overlap the stack at link time.

### Critical Safety Observation
Although there is no direct overlap at link time, WRAM headroom is extremely small:
- Free space between `_bend` and `__stack` is only `0x134` bytes.
- One Build 91 MAME exit reported `SP = 0xE0FFFEAC`, which is **32 bytes below `_bend`**.

Conclusion:
- The runtime stack has already entered BSS space.
- This can corrupt live variables and is a credible cause of bad sound/Z80 pointer state.

### Bus Collision Assessment
Double-shadow writes into `shadow_pages_0_1_wram` do **not** access the Z80 bus.
They are plain 68K WRAM accesses in the `0xE00000-0xFFFFFF` region.

A real 68K/Z80 bus arbitration issue would involve:
- Z80 RAM / YM access through `0xA00000+`
- Z80 bus request / reset control through `0xA11100` / `0xA11200`

Therefore:
- The new WRAM shadow buffer is **not physically overlapping** the Z80 communication ports.
- "Overstaying on the bus" is **not** the primary explanation for this fault.

### Interpretation of the `7FFF` Error
The Z80 memory map normally handles:
- `0000-1FFF` Z80 RAM
- `4000-5FFF` YM2612
- `6000-60FF` bank register
- `8000-FFFF` banked 68K window

A write to `7FFF` falls near the unhandled boundary between the bank register area and the banked 68K window.

Conclusion:
- This strongly suggests **bad address calculation, pointer wrap, or corrupted sound command state**.
- It does **not** look like a direct hardware overlap between WRAM and Z80 ports.

### Final Assessment
Primary diagnosis:
1. **Software pointer / wrap bug**
2. **Possible stack-overwrite corruption of sound state**
3. **Not a direct hardware bus collision**

### Recommendation
Next debug step:
- Instrument every 68K write path that targets Z80-visible addresses.
- Log the source pointer and computed destination before the `7FFF` fault.
- Also treat WRAM exhaustion as active: reduce stack usage or reclaim BSS before further sound debugging.

## [Architect Audit - Build 91.1 Boot Trap]

### 1. Forensic Analysis
**Confirmed: Fatal Hardware Conflict on Boot.**
The immediate crash-on-boot in accurate emulators (BlastEm, Exodus) is caused by the C runtime startup code (`crt0`) attempting to initialize the new `.sram_data` section.

### 2. Mechanism of Failure
- The linker is configured to place `.sram_data` at address `$200000`.
- The `crt0` boot code, which runs *before* `main()`, attempts to clear this section by writing zeros to it.
- On a real Genesis, the SRAM bus is disabled until a write to the control register at `$A130F1` occurs.
- Our `shadow_init()` function performs this enablement, but it is called from within `main()`, which is too late.
- The `crt0` write to the disabled bus at `$200000` causes an immediate hardware Bus Error (`BERR`), leading to a fatal CPU exception.

### 3. Emulator Behavior Differential
- **BlastEm / Exodus:** Correctly emulate the bus error, causing an instant crash as would be seen on physical hardware.
- **MAME:** Leniently ignores the illegal write to disabled SRAM, allowing `crt0` to complete and `main()` to run. The subsequent in-game crash is the unrelated Z80 bug from the previous build.

### 4. Conclusion
The boot trap is a hardware initialization order problem, not a pointer-math bug in the shadow API. The `.sram_data` section must be designated as a `NOLOAD` type in the linker script to prevent the C runtime from attempting to clear it at boot.

## [Implementer Update - Build 91.1 Reclamation & Unification (Manual SRAM Routing)]

### Implementation Status
- Removed ghost SRAM symbol usage from active code path:
  - `genesistan_shadow_200000_words`: not referenced in active build sources/specs/tooling.
- Removed compiler-managed SRAM section usage:
  - `.sram_data`: not present in active linker script.
- Kept 32KB WRAM shadow for Pages 0/1:
  - `shadow_pages_0_1_wram[16384]`
- Confirmed manual raw-pointer routing for Pages 2/3 in shadow API:
  - `shadow_write16` / `shadow_read16` write/read directly at
    `0x200000 + ((page - 2) * 0x4000) + offset` for `page >= 2`.

### Launcher Scrub / Reclamation (Before Arcade Handoff)
- In `main.c` (`scrub_launcher_runtime_buffers()`):
  - `graphics_test_tile_buffer` freed and nulled
  - `rastan_font_tile_buffer` scrubbed
  - `frontend_runtime_sprite_tile_buffer` scrubbed
  - `frontend_runtime_sprite_codes` scrubbed
  - `status_line` scrubbed
- In `startup_bridge.c` (`genesistan_reclaim_launcher_wram()`):
  - `genesistan_shadow_c20000_words` scrubbed
  - `genesistan_shadow_c40000_words` scrubbed
- Preserved state:
  - DIP settings (`genesistan_shadow_dip1`, `genesistan_shadow_dip2`)
  - service word (`genesistan_shadow_service_word`)
  - SRAM unlock control remains managed via `shadow_init()` (`0xA130F1`) and is not reset in launcher reclaim path.

### Build
- Command: `./tools/release_build.sh 91`
- Result: success
- Artifact: `dist/Rastan_91.bin`

- Hex distance (`__stack - _bend`): `0x134`

### Threshold Check

- Observed gap: `0x134`
- **Build Status by rule: FAILURE (gap below 16KB threshold).**

## [Architect Audit - Build 92 Memory Overlay]

### 1. Analysis of WRAM Exhaustion
**Confirmed: Static Allocation Inefficiency.**
The Build 91.1 failure to meet the 16KB stack-gap threshold (`__stack - _bend`) is caused by persistent `.bss` allocations for launcher-specific UI buffers.
- **Mechanism:** `memset` clears the *data* within these buffers before handoff to the arcade engine but does not de-allocate the memory. The linker has already reserved the WRAM permanently.
- **Conclusion:** The only way to reclaim this physical memory is to prevent the linker from allocating separate regions for the launcher and the engine in the first place.

### 2. Design for Build 92: WRAM Unification
To resolve the `.bss` bloat, the launcher's transient buffers and the engine's 32KB WRAM shadow buffer (`shadow_pages_0_1_wram`) will be overlaid in the same physical memory space using a C `union`.

### 3. Implementation Directive
A global `union WramOverlay` will be declared. It will contain two members:
1.  `uint16_t engine_shadow_wram[16384]`: The 32KB buffer for the engine.
2.  `LauncherRuntime launcher`: A `struct` containing all transient launcher UI buffers (`rastan_font_tile_buffer`, `frontend_runtime_sprite_tile_buffer`, etc.).

This forces the compiler to allocate only a single 32KB block. The individual global array declarations for the launcher buffers must be deleted and all code paths refactored to access them through the single `wram_overlay` instance.

### 4. Expected Outcome
- The total size of the `.bss` section will shrink significantly.
- The gap between `_bend` and `__stack` will increase, satisfying the 16KB safety threshold.
- The launcher and engine will correctly share the same WRAM footprint, as they are never active simultaneously.

## [External Consultant Audit - Build 90 Sound Hang]

### Incident
Build 90 reaches the In-Game state but produces a black screen and continuous buzzing sound.

BlastEm reports:
68K Write to unhandled z80 address 7FFF

### Hardware Analysis

The Z80 in the Genesis cannot directly access cartridge SRAM in a reliable or portable way.

The Z80 memory map is:

0000–1FFF  Z80 RAM  
2000–3FFF  YM2612  
4000–5FFF  VDP  
6000–60FF  bank register  
8000–FFFF  banked 68K memory window

Although the bank window can expose 68K memory, cartridge SRAM at $200000 is not guaranteed to behave as normal RAM due to SRAM enable logic and byte-wide implementations.

### Hybrid Map Impact

Build 90 uses a hybrid C-window layout:

Page0 ($C00000) -> WRAM  
Page1–3 ($C04000+) -> SRAM

From the perspective of the original arcade engine this region must behave as a **contiguous 64KB block**.

The WRAM/SRAM split breaks that assumption.

If the sound driver reads tables or sample pointers from this region, half the data will be inaccessible or corrupted from the Z80 perspective.

### Interpretation of the 7FFF Fault

A write to Z80 address 7FFF indicates the sound driver is executing corrupted data or using an invalid pointer.

This strongly suggests the driver read invalid memory due to the broken C-window layout.

The buzzing sound matches a Z80 driver stuck executing garbage instructions.

### Architectural Conclusion

The sound driver likely requires the entire C-window region to behave as **linear RAM accessible to both CPUs**.

The current WRAM/SRAM hybrid mapping violates this requirement.

### Recommendation

For the next build:

1. Ensure all memory visible to the Z80 resides in 68K WRAM.
2. Do not place sound driver tables or buffers in cartridge SRAM.
3. If SRAM must be used, restrict it to non-audio data.

### Verdict

Build 90 failure is consistent with a **Z80 driver crash caused by the split C-window mapping**.
